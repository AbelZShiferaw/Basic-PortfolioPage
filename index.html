			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr />
			<p><img src="assets/images/MyPhoto.jpg" alt="My Photo" title= "My Photo" width="200" height="200" align="LEFT" /> My name is Abel. I was born and raised in a small town called Woldiya, about 500km north of Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. I have two siblings, a brother and a sister. </p>
			<p> I studied Economics in my undergraduate degree at Jimma university, the second-ranking university in Ethiopia. I did two my graduate degrees, one in International Economics at Jonkoping university in Sweden and another in Financial Engineering/Quantitative Finance at Bologna University. I have been to more than 5 countreis in Europe. I came to the US as a PhD student, but decided to defer my admission to the coming year. My reason? Among others, I wanted to do something interesting with my life, like go to GW coding bootcamp. </p>
